🛍️ React E-Commerce Frontend

Project Overview

Welcome to the documentation for our comprehensive, high-performance e-commerce frontend application, built using React and designed for seamless client and administrative experiences. This project focuses on a responsive, intuitive user interface that connects to a separate backend API (detailed below).

The application is split into two primary experiences: the Shopfront for client transactions and the Admin Dashboard for complete operational control.

Key Features

🛒 Client & Shopfront Experience

The shopfront is built for speed and ease of use, ensuring clients can find and purchase products efficiently.

Seamless Ordering: Clients can browse the catalog, add products to their cart, and complete orders through a simple, intuitive checkout flow.

Intelligent Product Filtering: Users can easily refine their search using dynamic filtering options based on categories, price ranges, ratings, and more, ensuring quick product discovery.

Secure Authentication: User accounts allow for order history tracking and personalized shopping experiences.

🛡️ Administrative Control

Accessed via protected routes, the dedicated Admin Dashboard provides managers with the tools necessary to maintain inventory, manage transactions, and control access permissions.

Product Management (CRUD): Administrators have full control to Create, Read, Update, and Delete products, including managing inventory levels, pricing, and high-quality product assets.

Order Tracking & Fulfillment: A centralized system for viewing, processing, and updating the status of all incoming customer orders.

User Role Management: Granular security controls for managing user roles and permissions.

📈 Sales and Performance Analytics

The admin panel integrates an analytics view, designed to consume data from the backend to provide deep insights into sales performance.

Time-Based Reports: Visualize sales trends with detailed reports broken down by daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly metrics.

Data-Driven Decisions: Leverage clear charts and graphs to understand product performance and adjust strategies.
